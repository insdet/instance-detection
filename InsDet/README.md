# InsDet Dataset
The InsDet datase is a high-resolution real-world dataset for **Instance Detection** with **Multi-view Instance Capture**.<br>
We provide an InsDet-mini for demo and visualization. The full dataset will be released after paper acceptance.

## Dataset
The full dataset contains 100 objects with multi-view profile images in 24 rotation positions (per 15&deg;), 160 testing scene images with high-resolution, and 200 pure background images. The mini version contains 5 objects, 10 testing scene images, and 10 pure background images.

### Details
The **Objects** contains:
- 000_aveda_shampoo
  - images: raw RGB images (e.g., "images/001.jpg")
  - masks: segmentation masks generated by [GrabCut Annotation Toolbox](https://github.com/Kazuhito00/GrabCut-Annotation-Tool) (e.g., "masks/001.png")
- <p align="left"> $\vdots$ </p>
- 099_mug_blue

Tip: The first three digits specify the instance id.

The **Scenes** contains:
- easy
  - leisure\_zone
    - raw RGB images with 6144×8192 pixels (e.g. “office001/rgb\_000.jpg”)
    - bounding box annotation for objects in test scenes generated by labelImg toolbox and using PascalVOC format (e.g. “office\_001/rgb\_000.xml”)

Tip: Each bounding box is specified by [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax].

  - meeting\_room
  - office\_002
  - pantry\_room\_002
  - sink
- hard
  - office\_001
  - pantry\_room\_001

The **Background** contains 200 pure background images that do not include any instances from **Objects** folder.

## Code
The project is built on [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [segment-anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), and [DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2).<br>
<!-- Detectron2 provides end-to-end detectors implementation and metric evaluation. Segment-anything is an off-the-shelf class-agnostic segmentation model that we used to produce instance proposals. DINOv2 is a self-supervised vision foundation model that we used to extract feature representation. -->

### Data preparation
All profile images in InsDet-Objects are preprocessed by using `minify`, `resizemask`, `getbbox`, `centercrop`, and `invertmask` packed in `gendata/data_utils.py`.
